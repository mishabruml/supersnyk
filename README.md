# SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸

A Github Action to merge [automated Snyk PRs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/fix-pull-requests-for-new-vulnerabilities) against your repo into a single SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR

- PRs are detected via the incoming branch name (`snyk-fix-*` or `snyk-update-*`) and PR title `[Snyk] *`
- Snyk PRs will be automatically labelled with `snyk` label
- All Snyk PRs with the `snyk` label are merged together into a single SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR targeting `main` branch
- SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR body will be automatically updated with each child Synk PR using [autolink reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls)
- Merging the SuperSnyk ðŸ¦¸ PR will close all the snyky child PRs ðŸ˜›

## Motivation

Why does this project exist? Because I got tired of merging billions of snyk PRs one-by-one, waiting for CI, merging main back into the fix branch, waiting for CI... ðŸ˜´
